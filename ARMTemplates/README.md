# Running samples

The samples here are for showcasing how to ingest data from Office365.

The instructions below help you experiment with these samples using [Azure ARM template](https://github.com/Azure/azure-quickstart-templates).
For any sample, you can take a look at the `.\*-sample\azuredeploy.json` file to understand what azure resources we are deploying.

> **NOTE:** The samples here are not full managed app. When a customer decides to install your managed app from Azure marketplace, your app during installation, will perform steps similar to the below steps to provision resources in customer's azure subscription. For a full managed app take a look at `ManagedApp` at root of this repo.

## Deployment instructions

#### Step 1
Fire below command in shell of your choice and follow the instructions to login to your azure subscription.

```powershell
Login-AzureRmAccount
```

----------

#### Step 2
Fill in **all** the parameters in `.\*-sample\azuredeploy.parameters.json`. Refer `.\*-sample\azuredeploy.json` for description of the parameters.

Below parameters are common across all samples and can be filled using the `ManagedApp\Scripts\GetAppInstallationParameters.ps1` PowerShell script.

> **NOTE:** You don't need to run the script for every sample you try or every deployment. Same values can be re-used for every sample and every deployment.

- `destinationServicePrincipalId` is the Application Id of your service principal.
- `destinationServicePrincipalKey` is the Authentication Key you generated for your service principal.
- `destinationServicePrincipalAadId` is the Object Id of your service principal.

#### Step 3

Finally, deploy the ARM template and create the ADF pipeline by running the deployment script.

```shell
.\Deploy-AzureResourceGroup.ps1 -ResourceGroupLocation "eastus2" -ArtifactStagingDirectory *-sample
```

> **NOTE:** This will create all the resources in a resource group by the same name as the folder name of the sample (i.e. `ArtifactStagingDirectory`) For e.g. if you deploy `basic-sample` you'll find all the resource created in a resource group named `basic-sample`. So if you make changes to the `azuredeploy.json` and re-run the same command without changing the folder name, it will simply update the resources instead of creating new ones.
